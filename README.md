### Race Day

`let registeredEarly = prompt("Are you early?: ").toLocaleLowerCase === "yes";`

- If registeredEarly variable is equal to "yes", the comparison will evaluate to true (*truthy*) and the variable registeredEarly will be assigned the value of true. If the input is not "yes" the variable registeredEarly will be assigned the value of false (*falsey*). It's a one liner that check if the user is registered early or not by checking if the user input is 'yes' or not.
